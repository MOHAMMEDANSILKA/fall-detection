4. If you want to change ESP32 to use GET request (optional)
Instead of:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int httpResponseCode = http.POST(httpRequestData);
Use:

cpp
Copy
Edit
int httpResponseCode = http.GET();
and modify http.begin(serverName + "?data=" + message);
so that the data goes inside the URL itself!

Then in your phone app youâ€™ll see URLs like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
http://192.168.1.5:8080/?data=Temperature:28.5C
ðŸš€ Easy to check visually!

âš¡ In short:

Step	What you do
Install App	Start HTTP server on phone
Get IP/Port	Note down phoneâ€™s IP address and port
Update Code	Put correct IP and port in ESP32 program
(Optional)	If needed, change POST to GET for easier debug
Would you like me to send the small edit to your code if you want the GET method version too? It would make it super visible! ðŸ˜Ž
(Youâ€™ll see the data right inside the URL itself on your phone.)
ðŸ‘‰ Should I?
